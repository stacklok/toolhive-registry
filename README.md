# ToolHive Registry

This repository contains the registry of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers available for ToolHive. Each server entry provides AI assistants with specialized tools and capabilities.

## What is this?

Think of this as a catalog of tools that AI assistants can use. Each entry in this registry represents a server that provides specific capabilities - like interacting with GitHub, querying databases, or fetching web content.

## How to Add Your MCP Server

Adding your MCP server to the registry is simple! You just need to create a YAML file with some basic information about your server. We support two types of MCP servers:

1. **Container-based servers** - Run as Docker containers
2. **Remote servers** - Accessed via HTTP/HTTPS endpoints

### Step 1: Create a Folder

Create a new folder in the `registry/` directory with your server's name (use lowercase and hyphens):

```
registry/
  └── my-awesome-server/
      └── spec.yaml
```

### Step 2: Create Your spec.yaml File

Choose the appropriate format based on your server type:

#### For Container-based Servers

Create a `spec.yaml` file with this minimum information:

```yaml
# Required fields - you must provide these
image: docker.io/myorg/my-server:latest  # Your Docker image
description: What your server does in one sentence
transport: stdio  # How your server communicates (usually "stdio")

# Recommended fields - helps users understand your server
tools:
  - tool_name_1  # List the tools your server provides
  - tool_name_2
  
repository_url: https://github.com/myorg/my-server  # Where to find your code
```

#### For Remote Servers

Create a `spec.yaml` file with this minimum information:

```yaml
# Required fields - you must provide these
url: https://api.example.com/mcp  # Your MCP server endpoint
description: What your server does in one sentence
transport: sse  # Remote servers use "sse" or "streamable-http" (not "stdio")

# Recommended fields - helps users understand your server
tools:
  - tool_name_1  # List the tools your server provides
  - tool_name_2
  
repository_url: https://github.com/myorg/my-server  # Where to find your code
```

### Step 3: Add More Details (Optional but Helpful)

You can add more information to help users:

```yaml
# ... required fields above ...

# Tell users what environment variables they need
env_vars:
  - name: API_KEY
    description: Your API key from example.com
    required: true
    secret: true  # Mark sensitive data

  - name: TIMEOUT
    description: Request timeout in seconds
    required: false
    default: "30"

# Help users find your server
tags:
  - api
  - integration
  - productivity

# Server classification
tier: Community  # or "Official" if maintained by the protocol team
status: Active   # or "Beta", "Deprecated"
```

### Real Examples

#### Container-based Server Example

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:v0.10.0
description: Provides integration with GitHub's APIs for repository management
transport: stdio
repository_url: https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server

tools:
  - create_issue
  - create_pull_request
  - get_file_contents
  - search_repositories

env_vars:
  - name: GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    description: GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions
    required: true
    secret: true

tags:
  - github
  - version-control
  - api

tier: Official
status: Active
```

#### Remote Server Example

```yaml
url: https://api.example.com/mcp/v1
description: Provides access to Example API services via MCP
transport: sse
repository_url: https://github.com/example/mcp-server

tools:
  - fetch_data
  - process_request
  - submit_job

# Authentication headers for the remote server
headers:
  - name: X-API-Key
    description: API key for authentication
    required: true
    secret: true

# OAuth configuration (alternative to headers)
oauth_config:
  issuer: https://auth.example.com
  client_id: mcp-client
  scopes:
    - read
    - write

tags:
  - api
  - remote
  - cloud

tier: Community
status: Active
```

## Common Questions

### What is "transport"?

This tells ToolHive how to communicate with your server:

For **container-based servers**:
- `stdio` - Standard input/output (most common)
- `sse` - Server-sent events
- `streamable-http` - HTTP streaming

For **remote servers**:
- `sse` - Server-sent events (recommended)
- `streamable-http` - HTTP streaming
- **Note:** Remote servers cannot use `stdio`

If you're not sure, use `stdio` for containers and `sse` for remote servers.

### What is "tier"?

- `Official` - Maintained by the MCP team or platform owners
- `Community` - Created and maintained by the community (most servers)

### What is "status"?

- `Active` - Fully functional and maintained
- `Beta` - Still in development but usable
- `Alpha` - Early development, may have issues
- `Deprecated` - No longer maintained, will be removed

### Do I need a Docker image?

**For container-based servers:** Yes! Your MCP server must be packaged as a Docker image and published to a registry like:
- Docker Hub (`docker.io/username/image`)
- GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/username/image`)
- Other public registries

**For remote servers:** No! You just need to provide the URL endpoint where your MCP server is accessible.

### How do I test my entry?

After adding your entry, you can validate it:

```bash
# If you have the build tools installed
task validate
```

Or submit a pull request and our automated checks will validate it for you.

## Submitting Your Entry

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your server entry as described above
3. Submit a pull request
4. We'll review and merge your addition!

### Before Submitting, Please Ensure:

- [ ] Your Docker image is publicly accessible
- [ ] The `description` clearly explains what your server does
- [ ] You've listed all the tools your server provides
- [ ] Any required environment variables are documented
- [ ] Your server actually works with ToolHive

For **remote servers**:
- [ ] Your server endpoint is publicly accessible
- [ ] The `description` clearly explains what your server does
- [ ] You've listed all the tools your server provides
- [ ] Any required authentication (headers/OAuth) is documented
- [ ] The transport is set to `sse` or `streamable-http` (not `stdio`)
